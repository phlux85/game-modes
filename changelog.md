### Modes

#### Trackmania/Chase

#### Shootmania/Combo
* Matchmaking enhancements : vote map, rematch and progressive matchmaking.
* Setting "S_NbPlayersPerTeam" is replaced by "S_NbPlayersPerTeamMax".
* New setting "S_NbPlayersPerTeamMin".
* "S_NbPlayersPerTeamMin" and "S_NbPlayersPerTeamMax" controls the maximum and minimum number of players a clan must have in matchmaking.

#### Shootmania/ModeMatchmaking
* New rematch feature. At the end of a match the players can vote to play another one with the same people. If enough players agree a new match starts on the same server without going through the lobby again.
* New vote map feature. At the start of the match and at the end of each map the players can vote for the next map. Each player can vote for one map, all the maps that receive a vote are placed in a pool. If a map have several votes, it will be placed the same number of time in the pool. Then one map is chosen randomly in the pool to be the next one.
* New progressive matchmaking. When there's not enough players on the lobby, the matchmaking can start a match with less players and then send substitute to complete the match line up. Eg: 5vs5 Siege need 10 players on the lobby. With progressive matchmaking, the lobby can start a match with only 4 players. Then this match will receive substitutes from the lobby until there's 10 players.
* The matchmaking function is now ran much more frequently, every 10 seconds instead of 40 seconds.

### Modes

#### ModeBase
* All "synchronous" functions from the Mode library now have "asynchronous" equivalents in ModeBase. It allows to avoid calling a yield; in the library at the risk of missing important events (eg: XmlRpc events).

#### ShootMania/ModeMatchmaking
* It's now possible to show/hide on the client side the waiting screen, players list and masters list.
* Players kicked from a match won't be sent back to the match server when they rejoin the lobby. [see](http://forum.maniaplanet.com/viewtopic.php?p=219695#p219695)
* Three new XmlRpc methods to control the matchmaking function in the lobby : Matchmaking_Start, Matchmaking_Stop and Matchmaking_Force. With these it's now possible to stop/restart the matchmaking cleanly when needed (eg: before a restart/force next map).
* Fix : going to the next map after a vote won't restart the 60 seconds waiting time at the beginning of the map. [see](http://forum.maniaplanet.com/viewtopic.php?p=220073#p220073)
* Fix : going to the next map after a vote while the match was already started won't kick the players from the server anymore. [see](http://forum.maniaplanet.com/viewtopic.php?p=219976#p219976)

#### ShootMania/Siege
* Each checkpoint can now be associated with one, two or three gates instead of being forced at two.
* There is 45 seconds to capture all the checkpoint's gates. A bonus of 10 seconds is awarded when capturing a gate.
* The capture time of the gates is equal to 4.5 seconds divided by the number of gates at the checkpoints. eg: 3 gates -> 1.5 seconds each, 2 gates -> 2.25 seconds each, 1 gate -> 4.5 second.
* Only 2 ammo instead of 4 for the Rocket in attack. [see](http://forum.maniaplanet.com/viewtopic.php?p=219700#p219700)
* Play a sound only on attacker elimination instead of a different sound for defender and attacker elimination. [see](http://forum.maniaplanet.com/viewtopic.php?p=219700#p219700)
* New setting S_WeaponMode. It can take one of these values : 0 -> Rocket versus Laser, 1 -> select your weapon before the turn, 2 -> switch weapon during the turn. Default value is 2.
* New setting S_GatesStopDefenders. Select if players can walk through gates or not. Default value is True, so defenders can't go through gates anymore. [see](http://forum.maniaplanet.com/viewtopic.php?p=219700#p219700)
* It's now possible to move/hide some parts of the UI by pressing F8. It's also possible to hide/show the gates/spawn markers this way. [see](http://forum.maniaplanet.com/viewtopic.php?p=219700#p219700)

### Modes

#### ShootMania/Elite
* Initialize the dodge total from the scores table in ***InitMap*** instead of ***StartMap*** to avoid to keep the value from the previous match while waiting for the match to start in matchmaking. [see](http://forum.maniaplanet.com/viewtopic.php?p=218684#p218684)

* Add the total score (PlayerScore.Points + PlayerScore.PrevRaceDeltaPoints) to the LibXmlRpc_PlayerRanking callback. [see](http://forum.maniaplanet.com/viewtopic.php?f=261&t=27956&start=10#p218240)
